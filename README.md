#### Bartleby
###     the Scheduler

A scheduling system written in Common Lisp

After loading Bartleby, use (bartleby) to start up the interface.


### Testing
If you want to give it a try but don't have your own data to use, clients, employees, and rooms can be generated before starting the interface by using (generate-clients n), (generate-employees n), or (generate-rooms n), respectively.
